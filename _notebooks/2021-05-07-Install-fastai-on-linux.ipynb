    "There are some benefits to that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You dont depend on 3rd party service, you can run your environment anytime you want, even offline\n",
    "- You are more flexible with your code (you can run your notebooks not only in browser, but also in some IDE or text editor that you prefer)\n",
    "- You dont pay / wait for server to spin up\n",
